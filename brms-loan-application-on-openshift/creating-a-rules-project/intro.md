JBoss BRMS provides a web-based workbench that allows both developers and business users (e.g. business analysts) to create, manage and maintain business rules projects and business rules. This *workbench* is called **Business Central**.

Business Central provides a number of different BRMS functionalities:

- Asset/Rules Repository: A *Git*-based, version controlled, repository in which the BRMS projects and their assets (rules, decision tables, data-models, etc).
- Workbench: A set of editors, wizards and tools to allow the user to create and manage business rules.
- Artifact Repository:  A *Maven*-based repository which stores the (compiled) business-rules projects that can be deployed onto the execution environment.

In this course you will learn how to access the Business Central environment on JBoss BRMS. We will create an initial Asset Repository and our first Business-Rules Project.
