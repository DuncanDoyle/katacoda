OptaPlanner/JBoss Business Resource Planner (BRP) light-weight, powerful and scalable _Constraint Satisfaction Solver_ It optimizes business resource planning problems like *Vehicle Routing*, *Employee Rostering*, *Cloud Optimization*, and many more. It can be used in a vast array of scenario's and supports multiple deployment topologies. More information on JBoss BRMS can be found on the [Red Hat Website](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/business-rules) or the website of the [Red Hat Developer Program](https://developers.redhat.com/products/brms/overview/). More information on the community OptaPlanner project can be found on the [OptaPlanner WebSite](https://www.optaplanner.org).

In this course you will learn how to create your first JBoss Business Resource Planner solution. You will implement the *Cloud Balancing* demo, in which we will optimize the assignment of *Processes* to *Computers* (more information about this use case can be found in the [OptaPlanner manual](https://docs.optaplanner.org/7.2.0.Final/optaplanner-docs/html_single/#cloudBalancingTutorial).The project will be built in the JBoss BRMS web-based workbench that allows both developers and business users (e.g. business analysts) to create, manage and maintain business resource planning projects and their constraints. This *workbench* is called **Business Central**. We will deploy and run the rules on the lightweight and cloud-ready JBoss BRMS Decision Server.

The Katacoda backend we will be using is an OpenShift environment. Unfortunately, Katacoda does not provide the required resources to run the JBoss BRMS workbench. We will therefore run this scenario in a Docker runtime on our own machine. As such, a Docker installation on your machine is required to continue this scenario. We will however use the OpenShift instance in our Katacoda environment to run our planner project on the JBoss BRMS Decision Server.
